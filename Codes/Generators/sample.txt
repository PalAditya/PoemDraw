The nature looked absolutely beautiful with the large, snow capped peaks shining at us from a distance.
However, I couldn't help but feel wary: even with the sun shining brightly, the day was extremely cold.
I briefy frowned and thought back about the time I was enjoying a more pleasant time in my homeland;
that's right, among the lush green plains and the meadows, not worrying about anything else.

It was pretty amusing to think that I was lying on a open beach, looking at the blue see and sky. The weather was clear
and not the sun smiled brightly upon us.

Clear skies, a mountain to the left and sloshing waters of the ocean: what more could I need?
