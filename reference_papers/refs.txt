Plan: Tell sir that you want to run inception score and prove that this is no worse
than GauGAN and it all depends on first two phases.
Tell him about the below accuracy model and have him approve it.

A structured vs unstructured mode: Basically, create the secondary dataset where the context information is represented in a structural way.

Ex: The tree was to my left and mountain was to my right.

features: {
"nature" : ["tree", "mountain"],
"animal": [],
"position": []
}

The accuracy of the parser is based on it successfully associating the tree object 
with the left position and mountain with the right position.

{
	"mountain": {
			"position": "right",
			"size":"natural"
		},
		"tree": {
			"position": "left",
			"size":"natural"
		}
}
